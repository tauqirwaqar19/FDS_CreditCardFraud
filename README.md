# FDS_CreditCardFraud
The aim of this project is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning models.
We implement four machine learning algorithms namely **Logistic Regression**, **K Nearest Neighbour**, **Naive Bayes** and **Decision Tree**.
The main aim is to compare these machine learning models and find the most effective and accurate predictive model based on three evaluation metrics- Accuracy Score, F1 score and ROC curve.
